# Advent of Code 2020

Currently in C#, following the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

These are basically scripts, not works of art. Also and while the history will show the working for each stage, I'm not treating this as a re-runnable
treatise but instead as a record of some late-night hackery.
